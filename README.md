# Deep-learning-MINT
This study delves into the intricate world of Deep Learning (DL) models. 
The study extensively explores different factors that profoundly influence the performance of these models.
I have made different deep-learning models using MNIST dataset for handwritten numbers. 

The primary focus of this study is on understanding the capabilities and limitations of DL models in five key areas:

#Data Augmentation Techniques: The report investigates the impact of three different data augmentation techniques on model performance.

#Model Architectures: Three distinct model architectures with varying numbers of layers are explored to assess their predictive power and training efficiency.

#Activation Functions: The influence of three diverse activation functions on model behaviour is examined.

#DL Model Types: Each model type's strengths and weaknesses are explored.

#Optimization Methods: The effectiveness of three different optimization techniques is evaluated.

The report emphasizes the importance of maintaining user-friendliness while implementing alternative approaches and model architectures, ensuring that DL models remain accessible to a broad range of users.
