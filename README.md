# Deep Learning Model Comparison

This repository contains code for comparing the performance of different deep learning models on the MNIST dataset. The project explores three models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1-D Convolutional, and 2-D Convolutional models. The performance of each model is tracked using Weight & Biases (wandb) for loss and accuracy.

## Project Description

In this project, we evaluate the performance of different deep learning models on the MNIST dataset. Each model is implemented and trained using PyTorch, and their performance is tracked with Weight & Biases (wandb).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required libraries and dependencies. You can do this by running:
